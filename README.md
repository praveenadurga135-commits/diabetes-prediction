# Diabetes Prediction
Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression - ML classification project

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a person has diabetes based on health parameters using Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset `diabetes.csv` is included in this repository.  
It contains the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## Technology Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- Logistic Regression (Classification)

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **85%**.  
Other evaluation metrics (like confusion matrix, precision, recall) are available in the notebook.

## Conclusion
Logistic Regression is able to predict diabetes with good accuracy based on the dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Try Random Forest or SVM for better accuracy
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Add cross-validation
